                    <br />
                    When a Product is offered for sale as part of our Site,
                    ROYAL CANIN may accept your offer to purchase such Product
                    subject to these Terms. Customer's receipt of an electronic
                    or other form of order confirmation from ROYAL CANIN does
                    not signify ROYAL CANIN's acceptance of Customer's order,
                    nor does it constitute confirmation of ROYAL CANIN's offer
                    to sell. ROYAL CANIN reserves the right to accept or reject
                    Customer's order for any reason at any time after receipt of
                    Customer's order without providing a reason to Customer. If
                    ROYAL CANIN rejects Customer's order, ROYAL CANIN will
                    attempt to notify Customer using the contact information
                    provided with Customer's order but ROYAL CANIN disclaims any
                    responsibility or liability in the event Customer does not
                    receive any such attempted notification. Generally,
                    Customer's credit/debit card or bank account will not be
                    charged if ROYAL CANIN rejects an order; however, ROYAL
                    CANIN will process a refund if a charge has been made
                    against Customer's credit/debit card or bank account for a
                    rejected order.

                    <br />
                    ROYAL CANIN may, at its sole discretion, limit or cancel
                    quantities purchased. Restrictions may include orders placed
                    by the same account, orders that use the same credit/debit

                    and/or shipping address. If ROYAL CANIN makes a change to
                    Customer's order, ROYAL CANIN will attempt to notify
                    Customer using the contact information provided with
                    Customer's order but ROYAL CANIN disclaims any
                    responsibility or liability in the event Customer does not

                    </a>
                    <br />
                    This shipping and handling policy applies to orders
                    delivered to Customer. Orders delivered to Customer that are
                    filled from stock usually ship either the next business day
                    after the order is received or per the truck delivery
                    schedule in Customer's account area. ROYAL CANIN shall not
                    be liable for any delays, loss, or damage in transit. ROYAL
                    CANIN may, in its sole discretion, without liability or
                    penalty, make partial shipments of Products to Customer.
                    Each shipment will constitute a separate sale, and Customer
                    shall pay for the units shipped whether such shipment is in
                    whole or partial fulfillment of Customer's order. <br />
                    <br />
                    Customer may have the option to select “autoship” for the
                    fulfillment of Products, resulting in the automatic shipment
                    of Products selected by Customer on a preset frequency.
                    Customer can adjust certain Product specifications related
                    to such autoship option, including size, weight and delivery
                    frequency. Additionally, Customer may achieve product
                    savings in certain cases by opting for autoship services.
                    Please be advised that autoship is not a default feature and
                    requires Customer to “opt-in” through selection on the Site.
                    The default autoship frequency is delivery every four (4)
                    weeks. <br />
                    <br />
                    Title and risk of loss passes to Customer upon delivery of
                    the Products at Customer's location set forth in Customer’s

                    To purchase a Product, you will be required to provide ROYAL
                    CANIN information regarding your credit card or other
                    payment instrument (“Payment Method”). You represent and
                    warrant to ROYAL CANIN that such Payment Method is true and

                    responsible for all taxes and duties associated with
                    Products other than U.S. taxes based on ROYAL CANIN’s net
                    income. <br />
                    <br />
                    By providing a Payment Method, you are expressly agreeing

                    and charge you the fees, charges, or other amounts described

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ROYAL CANIN is required to comply with the sales and use tax
                    laws in the states in which it operates. In jurisdictions
                    that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax
                    unless specifically exempt by law. Certain purchases are
                    subject to tax even if ROYAL CANIN is not required to
                    collect sales or use tax by any particular jurisdiction.
                    Customer's purchase is NOT exempt from tax merely because
                    ROYAL CANIN does not collect the tax from Customer at the
                    time of Customer's purchase. Furthermore, Customer's
                    purchase is NOT exempt merely because it is made over the
                    Internet, by phone, or by other remote means. Customer shall
                    be solely responsible for any taxes not collected by ROYAL
                    CANIN and certain jurisdictions may require Customer (i) to
                    file a sales/use tax return annually reporting taxable
                    purchases that were not taxed and (ii) to pay such tax. For
                    more information, Customer should contact the applicable
                    taxing authority. If ROYAL CANIN collects sales or use tax
                    in connection with a purchase, the amount of the tax will
                    either be shown prior to completion of the purchase or
                    reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase. All
                    sales and use tax amounts collected by ROYAL CANIN are
                    remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities in a timely
                    and legally defined manner. <br />

                    the request is made within five (5) business days of Product
                    receipt. ROYAL CANIN will provide specific instructions on
                    the disposition of the Product. At ROYAL CANIN's sole
                    discretion, Products will be credited at the original
                    purchase price or replaced at no additional charge. <br />
                    <br />
                    Authorization of credits for order mistakes made by Customer
                    will only be granted if the request is made within thirty
                    (30) calendar days of Product receipt. ROYAL CANIN will
                    provide direction on the disposition of Customer's Product
                    return. Returned Product must be in saleable condition, in
                    the original packaging with no damage or written marks
                    indicating a return. If the Product is returned within
                    thirty (30) calendar days of delivery, credit for the full
                    purchase price will be issued. No credit will be issued
                    after thirty (30) calendar days.

                    ROYAL CANIN's failure to act with respect to Customer's
                    breach of these Terms or the breach of these Terms by others
                    does not waive ROYAL CANIN's right to act with respect to
                    similar or subsequent breaches. If any part of these Terms
                    is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such part will be
                    deemed automatically superseded by an enforceable, valid
                    provision most closely matching the intent of the original
                    provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in
                    effect. These Terms will be binding upon Customer and
                    Customer's successors and permitted assigns. Customer may
                    not assign any of Customer's rights or delegate any of
                    Customer's obligations hereunder without the express prior
                    written consent of ROYAL CANIN. All remedies available for
                    breach of these Terms are cumulative and may be exercised
                    concurrently or separately. The exercise of one remedy will
                    not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of
                    other remedies. While these Terms are automatically
                    effective, Customer agrees to execute and deliver such
                    further documents and assurances, if any, as may be required
                    from time to time to give effect to these Terms. Customer
                    shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and
                    ordinances. Customer shall maintain in effect all the
                    licenses, permissions, authorizations, consents and permits
                    that it needs to carry out its obligations under these
                    Terms. Provisions of these Terms which by their nature
                    should apply beyond their terms will remain in force after
                    any termination or expiration of these Terms. These Terms
                    are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
                    respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
                    herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer

                    breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling

                    such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or

                    be deemed made and entered into in the State of Missouri and
                    shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
                    Missouri but excluding its and all other jurisdictions
                    choice of law principles. Customer agrees to and submits to
                    the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of or in the State of

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
                      Customer and ROYAL CANIN with respect to the sale of goods
                      and supersedes any prior agreements, understandings,
                      contracts, instruments, negotiations and discussions with
                      respect to the subject matter hereof, whether written or
                      oral, all of which are of no further force and effect.
                      These Terms expressly supersede all provisions in any
                      purchase order. If a written contract signed by both
                      parties is in existence covering the sale of the goods
                      covered hereby, the terms and conditions of said contract
                      shall prevail to the extent they are inconsistent with
                      these Terms. These Terms prevail over any of Customer's
                      general terms and conditions of purchase regardless
                      whether or when Customer submitted its purchase order or
                      such terms. Fulfillment of Customer's order does not
                      constitute acceptance of any of Customer's terms and
                      conditions and does not serve to modify or amend these
                      Terms. These Terms may be amended, modified, or terminated
                      by ROYAL CANIN at any time in its sole discretion. ROYAL
                      CANIN shall post any updates to these Terms on the Site.

                      would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to us

                      that we have the right to enforce the provisions of these
                      Terms by injunction (without necessity of posting bond),
